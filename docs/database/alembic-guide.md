# Alembic Migration Guide

## Overview

Alembic manages database schema migrations across the bounded contexts. Each context has its own migration directory and Alembic revision line, allowing independent schema versioning per domain.

## Directory Structure

```
apps/alembic/
├── alembic.ini
├── env.py              # shared environment config
├── job/
│   └── versions/       # job schema migrations
├── company/
│   └── versions/       # company schema migrations
├── skill/
│   └── versions/       # skill schema migrations
├── candidate/
│   └── versions/       # candidate schema migrations
└── shared/
    └── versions/       # shared schema migrations
```

## Setup

- **Config**: `alembic.ini` (repo root)
- **Environment**: `apps/alembic/env.py`
- **Version locations**: configured per context in `alembic.ini`

```ini
version_locations = apps/alembic/job/versions apps/alembic/company/versions apps/alembic/skill/versions apps/alembic/shared/versions apps/alembic/candidate/versions
```

## Schema Configuration

Each bounded context owns a PostgreSQL schema:

| Context    | Schema      | Migration Dir                 |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Job        | `job`       | `apps/alembic/job/`           |
| Company    | `company`   | `apps/alembic/company/`       |
| Skill      | `skill`     | `apps/alembic/skill/`         |
| Candidate  | `candidate` | `apps/alembic/candidate/`     |
| Shared     | `shared`    | `apps/alembic/shared/`        |

The `env.py` imports all models per context so Alembic can autogenerate
migrations for all schemas. `include_schemas=True` ensures schema-aware
operations, and `include_object` respects `ALEMBIC_TARGET_SCHEMA` for
single-schema autogenerate.

## Non-Negotiable: Generate First, Then Tune

> **Every new migration MUST be created by Alembic autogenerate FIRST, then
> tuned. Never hand-author a migration file from scratch.**

The generated file is authoritative for the **revision-graph references** —
`revision`, `down_revision`, `branch_labels` and `depends_on`. Only Alembic can
compute these correctly (which migration is the parent, whether a new context
is a fresh branch, where the revision must chain, and whether a merge/head is
needed). Manually guessing these headers corrupts the migration history.

Workflow:

1. **Modify ORM models** in the context's model file.
2. **Scaffold the new context** (only for a brand-new bounded context) before
   generating:
   - add the schema to `SCHEMAS` in
     `apps/backend/shared/infrastructure/database/sqlalchemy_config.py`
   - add its `versions/` dir to `version_locations` in `alembic.ini`
   - import its models in `apps/alembic/env.py`
3. **Generate**: `uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<description>"`
   (optionally `ALEMBIC_TARGET_SCHEMA=<schema>` to scope a single context).
   For a brand-new context branch pass `--branch-label <context>` and
   `--version-path apps/alembic/<context>/versions`.
4. **Tune the CONTENT ONLY**: add `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS`, indexes,
   naming, FKs, review column types. You may rename the file and revision id to
   match repo convention (e.g. `candidate_001_initial_candidate_schema.py` with
   `revision = "candidate_001"`) **provided nothing references the original id
   and the tuned id stays consistent across history/DB stamp**.
5. **Verify**: `uv run alembic history`, `uv run alembic heads` (single head),
   `uv run alembic upgrade head`, then a downgrade → upgrade round-trip.
6. **Commit** the migration with its implementation-history file.

Do NOT hand-edit the header references (except the repo-convention rename above)
after generation. If the graph is wrong, re-run autogenerate instead.

## Recent Schema Additions

- **`job_analysis` table** (schema `job`) was added by migration
  `42c200d12fd5_add_job_analysis_table.py` (`42c200d12fd5`). It stores the
  canonical per-job AI analysis: `id`, `job_id` (String(36), unique
  `uq_job_analysis_job_id`), `payload` (JSON text), `fit_score`,
  `success_score`, `overall_score`, `recommendation`, `apply_reason`,
  `summary`, `prompt_version`, `schema_version`, `generated_at`.

- Autogenerate can be scoped to a single schema via the
  `ALEMBIC_TARGET_SCHEMA` environment variable (see `apps/alembic/env.py`).
  Migration `42c200d12fd5` is **existence-guarded** (`_table_exists` check
  before `create_table`) so it is non-destructive and safe to run against
  databases where startup `Base.metadata.create_all()` already created the
  table.

## Common Commands

Run all commands from the repository root (`alembic.ini` lives at the root,
with per-context `version_locations`).

### Check current migration state for all contexts

```bash
uv run alembic current
```

### View migration history

```bash
uv run alembic history
```

### Generate a new migration (autogenerate, scoped to one schema when needed)

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
ALEMBIC_TARGET_SCHEMA=<schema> uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
```

For a brand-new context branch (e.g. `candidate`):

```bash
ALEMBIC_TARGET_SCHEMA=candidate uv run alembic revision --autogenerate \
  --version-path apps/alembic/candidate/versions \
  --branch-label candidate -m "initial candidate schema"
```

### Apply pending migrations

```bash
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

### Merge divergent migration heads

If `uv run alembic upgrade head` fails with
`Multiple head revisions are present for given argument 'head'`, two migration
lines diverged from a common ancestor (e.g. two feature migrations were created
from the same base). Re-join them into a single head with a merge migration:

```bash
uv run alembic merge -m "merge <desc-a> and <desc-b> heads" <head_a> <head_b>
```

Then commit the generated merge file. Verify with `uv run alembic heads` (must
show a single head) before running `uv run alembic upgrade head`.

### Rollback one migration

```bash
uv run alembic downgrade -1
```

### Rollback to a specific revision

```bash
uv run alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

### Stamp a database as up-to-date (without running migrations)

```bash
uv run alembic stamp head
```

## Migration Workflow

Follow the **Non-Negotiable: Generate First, Then Tune** section above:

1. Modify ORM models in the context's model file
2. Generate the migration with autogenerate (never hand-write from scratch)
3. Tune the content only (schema creation, indexes, naming, review)
4. Test the migration: `uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run alembic downgrade <prev> && uv run alembic upgrade head`
5. Commit the migration with its implementation-history file

## Review Process

Always review auto-generated migrations before committing:

- Check for unintended column type changes
- Verify index creation/deletion
- Ensure schema operations are correct (CREATE SCHEMA, SET search_path)
- Test both upgrade and downgrade paths
- **No cross-context foreign keys** (AGENTS.md rule 15): FKs are allowed only
  within a bounded context's own schema; cross-context links (e.g.
  `candidate_skills.skill_id` → `skill.skills`) are plain logical-reference
  columns with no `ForeignKey(...)` constraint
- Confirm the revision header references (`revision`, `down_revision`,
  `branch_labels`) came from autogenerate and were not guessed by hand

## How Models Connect to Alembic

Alembic's `env.py` imports the `Base` object and every context's model package
(e.g. `candidates.infrastructure.models.candidate_model`) so all tables
register with `Base.metadata`. The `target_metadata = Base.metadata` line tells
Alembic to inspect all registered tables across all schemas for autogeneration.
When you add a new context (or a new model file), register it in `env.py`
**before** generating the migration, or autogenerate will not see it.

## Data Migrations

For data transformations (backfills, renames, etc.), use Alembic's `op.execute()` with raw SQL or Python code in the `upgrade()` function:

```python
def upgrade():
    op.add_column('jobs', sa.Column('new_col', sa.Text()), schema='job')
    op.execute("UPDATE job.jobs SET new_col = old_col")
```

## Running Migrations with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
docker-compose up alembic-migrate
```

The `alembic-migrate` service runs `alembic upgrade head` and exits.

## Troubleshooting

### "Table already exists" error
The database already has the table. Use `alembic stamp head` to mark it as current.

### Migration doesn't detect changes
Ensure all models are imported in `apps/alembic/env.py` (one import per context
model package). If the new models aren't registered with `Base.metadata`,
autogenerate cannot see them — and this must be done **before** generating.

### Cross-schema foreign key confusion
Alembic may reorder migration creation. If a migration references a table from another schema created in a different migration file, ensure the referenced migration runs first by specifying `depends_on` in the revision header.
