# Add Company

## Purpose

The Add Company drawer imports a new company via `POST /api/companies` and,
when queued, processes it through the shared `ProcessingExecution` lifecycle
(`COMPANY_PROCESSING`). It is the company variant of the shared **Create Entity
drawer** (also used by the Add Job drawer, see
`docs/ux/features/jobs/add-job.md`).

The form follows this field order: **primary link → optional name → additional
links → optional notes**.

# Behavior

## Primary Link

The primary link is the main source for the company and is required. The URL is
typed into the input; URLs missing a scheme are prefixed with `https://`.

Every time the drawer opens, if the clipboard holds a URL (matching
`http(s)://…`), it is automatically pasted into the Primary Link field unless
the field is already populated — matching the Add Job drawer behavior. An empty
or non-URL clipboard is ignored silently.

A title can be selected from the preset chips **Website** and **LinkedIn**.
Clicking a chip toggles it on/off. Only one primary title can be active.

## Company Name

Optional. If provided, the name is persisted with the company and shown in the
Companies list. If empty, the primary link URL is used as the display name.

## Additional Links

The `+ Add` toggle reveals URL + title inputs. Quick preset titles: LinkedIn,
Website, Careers, GitHub. If Website or LinkedIn is already selected as the
primary title, that chip is disabled in the additional-link selector. URLs
missing a scheme are prefixed with `https://`.

## Notes

Optional free-text notes. Each note is typed into the textarea and added with
the `+` button. Notes whose content starts with `http` are treated as URLs
(rendered as links). Notes can be removed before submit.

## Submit

Two actions are offered in the footer:

| Action      | Behavior                                       | State   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Add         | Adds the company to the list, no processing.   | Enabled |
| Add & Queue | Adds the company and queues it for processing. | Enabled |

`Add` posts `POST /api/companies` with:

```json
{
  "name": "Acme GmbH",
  "notes": [{ "content": "..." }],
  "links": [{ "url": "https://acme.example", "title": "Website" }],
  "source": "web",
  "queue": false
}
```

The backend creates a `company.companies` row with status `created` and
persists the name and URL notes. With `queue: false` the company is **not**
processed — it can be reprocessed later from the row/detail actions. When
`queue: true`, a `COMPANY_PROCESSING` `ProcessingExecution` is created and
enqueued, and the response includes `execution_id`.

## After Submit

- A success toast is shown.
- The companies-v2 list query is invalidated.
- The drawer closes.
- The entry appears in the Companies list (with processing status from
  `latest_processing_execution`).
- The Processing Drawer is **not** opened automatically (unlike the Job Create
  & Queue flow).

## Validation

Submit is disabled while:

- There is no primary link URL.
