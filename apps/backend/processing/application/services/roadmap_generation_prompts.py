"""Roadmap Generation prompt builders — the single LLM call that produces a
job-preparation roadmap from existing Career Intelligence.

Each builder produces a versioned prompt plus its strict output JSON schema.
The LLM call always goes through LLMService (AGENTS.md rule #1) and the result
is validated against the mirrored Pydantic models in
``roadmap_generation_validation``.

The generator is a *consumer* of existing intelligence: the prompt is grounded
in the persisted job analysis, company intelligence and candidate profile. It
never re-analyzes the job, company or user (spec 144 §13).

{_sections(context, ["job", "job_skills", "company", "candidate"])}

ROADMAP RULES:
1. milestones: between 3 and 8. Each milestone is a meaningful OUTCOME the user achieves (e.g. "Ship a Kafka-based project", "Pass the interview loop"), never a bare topic.
   - title: short outcome statement.
   - description: 1-2 sentences on why this milestone matters for THIS role.
   - priority: "critical" (blocks the application / core to the role), "high", "medium", or "low".
   - success_criteria: how the user will know the milestone is done (concrete, verifiable).
   - skills: only the skills this milestone develops, picked from the job-required skills tagged by the analysis (use each skill's canonical name). At most 5 per milestone.
   - tasks: between 1 and 8 concrete, actionable steps. Each task has a title, a short description, an estimated_effort ("3-4 hours", "2 days", ...), and a success_criteria.
2. Order milestones to close the smallest meaningful set of gaps first (prioritize skills tagged "missing" then "low" in the analysis). Focus on the role's core requirements — do not pad the roadmap.
3. goal: the goal type is always "JOB"; give it a concise title and description.
4. title: a short, human-readable roadmap title.
