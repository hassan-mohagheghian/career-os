"""Application Intelligence prompt builders — tailored resume and cover letter
generation.

Each builder produces a versioned prompt plus its strict output JSON schema.
The LLM call always goes through LLMService (AGENTS.md rule #1) and the result
is validated against the mirrored Pydantic models in
``application_intelligence_validation``.

These generators are *consumers* of existing Career Intelligence: the prompt is
grounded in the persisted job analysis, company intelligence and candidate
profile. They never re-analyze the job, company or user.

Write a complete, professional resume as MARKDOWN (not JSON) that:
1. Is tailored to THIS job posting and THIS company — mirror the job's required skills and the company's technology/culture signals.
2. Uses ONLY facts from the candidate profile below. Never invent experience, skills, employers or dates.
3. Emphasizes the candidate's matched skills and achievements that map to the job's required skills (from the job analysis).
4. Ordering: contact/header → professional summary (2-3 lines) → core competencies (skills relevant to the job) → experience (reverse chronological) → projects → education → certificates → languages.
5. Uses markdown headings (##), bullet lists, and bold for job titles / company names.

{_sections(context, ["job", "company", "candidate"])}

PLACEHOLDERS:
- In the contact/header block ONLY, use placeholder tokens for the candidate's personal details exactly as: {CONTACT_PLACEHOLDERS}.
- The user fills these values on the Placeholders page before download — never hardcode a personal detail you are not certain about; keep the token so it can be filled.
- Do NOT use placeholder tokens anywhere else (skills, experience, projects stay concrete from the profile).

CONSTRAINTS:
- Output ONLY the resume markdown content inside the JSON envelope "content". No preamble, no code fences.
- Keep the resume to at most one page of focused content — every bullet must be high-signal for this specific application.
- Do not add placeholder sections the candidate has no data for.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON matching exactly this schema:
